# Java Programming Exercises

This repo contains all of my Java programming exercises (known as EPs in Portuguese) from the Computing I and II classes as delivered.

Some of them are incomplete, which I should have already fixed by now, but well 🤷‍♀️.

Use at your own discretion! Please do not just copy paste them into your own assignments as that could be troublesome (for you at least).
