Everything was in confusion in Oblonskys' house. The wife had discovered that the husband was carrying an intrigue with a French girl, who had been a governess in their family, and she had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with him.  This position on affairs had now lasted three days, and not only the husband and wife themselves, but all the members of their family in the household, were painfully conscious of that. Every person in the house felt that there was no sense in living together, and that the stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in comon with one another than they, the members of the family and household of the Oblonskys. The wife did not not leave her own room, the husband had not been at home for three days. The childen ran wild all overthe house; the English governess quarreled with the housekeeper, and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new situation for her; the man-cook had walked of the day before just at dinner time; the kitchen-maid, and the coachman had given warning.
